# Your task is to create a function that will take an integer and return the result of the look-and-say function on that integer.
# This should be a general function that takes as input any positive integer, and returns an integer;
# inputs are not limited to the sequence which starts with "1".
#
# Conway's Look-and-say sequence goes like this:
#
# Start with a number.
# Look at the number, and group consecutive digits together.
# For each digit group, say the number of digits, then the digit itself.
# This can be repeated on its result to generate the sequence.
# Example:
# Start with 21. There is one 2 and one 1 --> 1211
# Start with 1211. There is one 1, one 2, and two 1s --> 111221
