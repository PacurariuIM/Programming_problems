1. Roman numbers
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50

2. Numbers are formed by addition

3. Some numbers are formed by subtraction:
    I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
    X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
    C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

4. We receive a roman number as input

5. We create a collection of key:value with roman symbols and corresponding number

6. We go through the collection, subtracting the lower number if followed by a higher one, adding the others

7. We return the integer result
