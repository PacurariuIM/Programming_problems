Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

1. First and last strings don't have to be considered, we need a substring not a subsequence

2. We create a new set, which will hold all the unique values that we add with the 2 pointers, left and right.

3. If we come across a duplicate value to the right, we delete the one to the left from the set.

4. We return the max size of the set, after a complete iteration.
